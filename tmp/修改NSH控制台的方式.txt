1. 硬件方式1
   直接硬件端口
2. 使用1个模块进行映射

nshterm /dev/ttyS1  ：
nshterm /dev/ttyACM0：
nshterm /dev/ttyS0  ：

* You can also get an Nuttx Terminal on USART6, PC6 (TX) and PC7 (RX). You have to write “nshterm /dev/ttyS1” 
	in the Nuttx Terminal and then change your Cables to the USART6 pins.

* To get back to USART2 write “nshterm /dev/ttyS0” in the Nuttx Terminal 
	and change your Cables back to the USART2 pins.

* You could also get an Nuttx Terminal over the USB Bootloader Port. You have to write “nshterm /dev/ttyACM0” 
	in the Nuttx Terminal, open a second teraterm and connect to the Bootlaoder USB Comport (you may have to check Device Manager to verify).

* You could do also some “tests”, but most will fail. One who works the following: change your Nuttx Terminal to the USB Bootloader Port, 
  write “tests uart_baudchange” on the Nuttx Terminal which will write to your USART6 the following string “UART2 #” 100 times

Congratulations! The PX4 firmware is now running on your STM32F4 Discovery kit.
