    Fix the LED PWM support for non shared timers
    
      This is the fixes https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/5710
      by adding 2 concepts.
    
      1) Allowing a board to define BOARD_HAS_SHARED_PWM_TIMERS
         in this case the io_timeris will be initalized as the
         led_pwm_timers  - there is an assumptionm that the
         number of io_timers == the number of led_pwm timers
    
      2) Allowing a board to define BOARD_LED_PWM_RATE
         To set an alternate frequency
    
      Future expansion will require:
      1) The ability to have a config with both the I2C RGB LED and
         PWM RGB LED drivers loaded.
      2) The higher level driver to create  multiple instances of the
         /dev/rgbld, to support internal and  external User facing
         RGB LED as supported in FMUv5
